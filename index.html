    <h1>Mordhau Trainer</h1>
    <p>This is gonna record my keybindings and register them while training. I'm gonna give numbers from 1 - 7 for the different attacks. All of them are key binded.</p>
    <p>One random number is gonna appear on the screen (on the second one) and I have to act accordingly. This will help me putting all the attacks to my muscle memory.</p>
